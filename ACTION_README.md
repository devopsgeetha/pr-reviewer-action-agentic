## Usage

Add to your repository's `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: read
    steps:
      - name: AI PR Review
        uses: yourusername/pr-reviewer-action@v1
        with:
          openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Setup

1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add it to your repository secrets as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Add the workflow file above (make sure to include the `permissions` block!)
4. Create a PR and watch the magic happen! ✨

**Important**: The `permissions` block is required for the action to post comments on PRs. Without it, you'll get a 403 "Resource not accessible by integration" error.

## Troubleshooting

### 403 Forbidden Error

If you're getting a 403 error when the action tries to post comments:

1. **Check your workflow file has permissions**: Make sure your workflow includes the `permissions` block as shown in the example above.

2. **Verify the permissions are correct**: The job needs:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     issues: write
     pull-requests: read
   ```

3. **Fork PRs**: If the PR is from a fork, `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited permissions. You may need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope instead:
   ```yaml
   - name: AI PR Review
     uses: yourusername/pr-reviewer-action@v1
     with:
       openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
       github_token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}  # Use PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

4. **Repository settings**: Check that your repository allows GitHub Actions to write to issues/comments in Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions.

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
